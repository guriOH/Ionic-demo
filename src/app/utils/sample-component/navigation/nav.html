Nav is a standalone component for loading arbitrary components and pushing new components on to the stack.

Unlike Router Outlet, Nav is not tied to a particular router. This means that if we load a Nav component, and push other components to the stack, they will not affect the app's overall router. This fits use cases where you could have a modal, which needs its own sub-navigation, without making it tied to the apps URL.
